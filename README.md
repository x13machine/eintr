# Eintr News Aggregator
Source Code for the a news aggregator I made a year ago.  I couldn't figure out a business plan for it. I might use the code for a later project. The rss reader might be buggy. You can only use it for non-commercial purposes only.

## Install (probably, I'm going off my memory)
* First, You need to install redis,solr, postgresql.
* Next run npm install for bot and the web code.
* Add sources in the "sources" postgresql table and to the bot/sources.json file
* Add oath2 google settings in the web/config.json file

FYI: Unfortunately I don't have the solr files. Probably wouldn't be too hard to recreate.
